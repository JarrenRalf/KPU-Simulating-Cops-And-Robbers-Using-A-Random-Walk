# KPU-Simulating-Cops-And-Robbers-Using-A-Random-Walk
For an upper levels computer programming course called Simulations, myself and two other classmates designed a project that was intended to simulate buglaries using the mathematical concept of a random walk. The idea for this project was inspired by a TED talk I had really enjoyed watching of Dr. Hannah Fry, where are the 4:39 minute mark, she began talking about a research group at UCLA who modelled burglary hot spots.

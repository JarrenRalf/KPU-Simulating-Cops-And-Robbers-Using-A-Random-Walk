# KPU-Simulating-Cops-And-Robbers-Using-A-Random-Walk
For an upper levels computer programming course called Simulations, myself and two other classmates designed a project that was intended to simulate buglaries using the mathematical concept of a random walk. The idea for this project was inspired by a TED talk I had really enjoyed watching of Dr. Hannah Fry, where are the 4:39 minute mark, she began talking about a research group at UCLA who modelled burglary hot spots.

This project challenged my partners and I to incorporate several algorithms central to the themes of our coursework. For example, we needed to create an environment that had an effect on the objects instantiated with in. Our grid system that the "Robbers" move within, is based off the [Cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton) idea, specificxally a Moore neighboorhood. Not only does our environment have an effect on the Robbers, the Robbers and the Police have an effect on the environment.
